                  introduction to modern generalized linear models for
                  categorical variables. The text emphasizes methods that are
                  most commonly used in practical application, such as classical
                  inferences for two- and three-way contingency tables, logistic
                  regression, loglinear models, models for multinomial (nominal
                  and ordinal) responses, and methods for repeated measurement
                  and other forms of clustered, correlated response
                  data. Chapter headings remain essentially with the exception
                  of a new one on Bayesian inference for parametric
                  models. Other major changes include an expansion of clustered
                  data, new research on analysis of data sets with robust
                  variables, extensive discussions of ordinal data, more on
                  interpretation, and additional exercises throughout the
                  book. R and SAS are now showcased as the software of
                  choice. An author web site with solutions, commentaries,
                  software programs, and data sets is available.",

 abstract = {The quality of a product might be determined by several parameters, each of which must meet certain standards before the product is acceptable. In this article, a method of determining whether all the parameters meet their respective standards is proposed. The method consists of testing each parameter individually and deciding that the product is acceptable only if each parameter passes its test. This simple method has some optimal properties including attaining exactly a prespecified consumer's risk and uniformly minimizing the producer's risk. These results are obtained from more general hypothesis-testing results concerning null hypotheses consisting of the unions of sets.},

 abstract = {Bivariate extreme value distributions arise as the limiting distributions of renormalized componentwise maxima. No natural parametric family exists for the dependence between the marginal distributions, but there are considerable restrictions on the dependence structure. We consider modelling the dependence function with parametric models, for which two new models are presented. Tests for independence, and discriminating between models, are also given. The estimation procedure, and the flexibility of the new models, are illustrated with an application to sea level data.},
